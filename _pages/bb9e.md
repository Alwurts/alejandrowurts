This project is my pursuit to build a Robot Sphere that is based on 1/3rd scale functional BB9E droid. 
Different topics where researched like Drive Systems, Head Movement Mechanism, Motors and Electronics control.

One of the goals for the project was to keep everything simple in order to save costs and also use parts that are normally available in electronics shops that way the project could be easily replicated if desired.

The project was divided in 3 main sections 

- Drivetrain mechanism 
- Electronics controls
- Software controls

The current working version of the robot is V2
