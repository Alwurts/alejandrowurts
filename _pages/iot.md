Currently I have to projects that can be considered as IOT devices.

IOT Switch
---------------

This project is about designing and making a IOT Switch which uses MQTT as a protocol of communication. The IOT switch is also able to communicate with Amazon Alexa and interact with it.

IOT LED Matrix Clock
---------------

The LED Matrix Clock can convert its LED resolution from a 8 x 64 single height format to a 16 x 32 double height format and vice versa.
