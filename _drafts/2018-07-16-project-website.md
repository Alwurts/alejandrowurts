Hi and welcome to my website, this is the first post about projects that i engage on, for school, learning or just for fun.

I like to always try new techniques and new projects allow me to do that.

Creating this website and getting to a point where i can simply write my posts about my projects is one of them.

The steps that i took to make this website are more-less the next ones:

- Learning Jekyll:
  I choose jekyll not because of the language Ruby i actually don't have much experience with ruby other than the one i have gained in here instead i choose Jekyll because it seemed the popular option which in turn normally brings a lot of examples online that i could use to set-up my website.

- Choosing a theme:
  This was probably one of the hardest things to do, since there are many options online to choose from, i started thinkering with a theme called sleek that is quite nice looking, however when using it i quickly runned into trouble.
  Finally i decided to use a theme that had very good documentation calle minimal-mistake, let me tell you it's quite easy to use and comes with almost everything you would need for a basic website.
  
- Github:
  This is basic for anyone that is interested in programming in anyway, I had used git before but my skills where a little rusty since i dont use it, so a simple tutorial was all i need it; As an option Github Desktop is a great tool if you are into a graphic experience rather than comman line.
  So Github in short just helps you put your jekyll files from your computer into the internet so you can publish them as a website, aditionally github offers github pages which lets you build your website really easily but i choose netlify for its more robust offerings.
  
- Learning how to use Netlify:
  This was very easy since netlify basically guides you to every step to connect your github repository where your jekyll files live to netlify and have it published as a website.

- Custom domain:
  In order to make my website more professional looking i decided to invest in a domain and settle for the name "alejandrowurts.com" after that it was just a matter of pointing the DNS settings to the netlify webpage and we had a pretty good looking website.

This is actually one of the posts that im writing in order to test the funcionality of the website so if its not perfect just dont laugh, i may delete it or keep it for the future.

Until the next time Bye!!
