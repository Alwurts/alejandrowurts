Welcome to my website my name is Alejandro Wurts Santos and i'm a Mexican mechatronics engineer.

I like to do random projects every now and then in anything that revolves around the concept of making; My projects take on Arduino, CAD, 3D Printing, and Electronics in general.

Below you can find links to my Project, Blog and About me sections.
