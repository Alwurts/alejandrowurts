A few months back I decided to finally take the leap and get my very own 3D printer. After doing some research I was ready to buy an FLSUN brand machine, but reviews of this new amazing creality machine named the Ender 3 came out and knowing that Creality has offered quality before I decided to go an get it from Aliexpress.

It only took a few days for my printer to arrive, only to find out that the customs people had opened the package and left everything a mess. Nevertheless I started building the printer using the manual that came in the box.

Following the manual was easy as I think its well designed. All in all building the 3D printer took me about 2 hours of work considering I took things slow. At the end of building the result was the next one.

After building the printer I downloaded the Benchy file form Thingiverse and sliced using the Cura Ultimaker software. The print that I got using hatchbox balck PLA with default slicer settings and a fresh out of the box printer was very good.

For a while I left the printer mostly stock, except for some minor cosmetic upgrades such as cable clamps, fan covers etc, other than those upgrades the printer was left untouched and worked flawless. Here is another example of a piece while printing, this piece in particular is for the V2 version of my Robot Sphere BB9E.

In order to improve the functioning of the printer I bought a Bltouch upgrade and dampeners for the stepper motors. I must say the dampeners are the best upgrade I have donde, it made my printer really quiet conmpared to stock, I can be sleeping on a room besides the printer and not hear a thing.

The Bltouch was a very good upgrade too, and if you have some experience with arduinos and such, it shouldn't be to hard to perform.

Another big upgrade is to add Octoprint to your setup using a Raspberry Pi, in the picture below you can see how I can manage all my printer settings, and also monitor how a print is going via a camera interface.
