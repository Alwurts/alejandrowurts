DIY Electric Scooter with 500W DC Motor
===============

Introduction
--------------

For a school project me and some friends had to design and build from scratch an electric scooter, that was capable of carrying a person of around 100 Kg (220 lb) at a speed of around 20 km/h (12 mph). 

Design
------------

As rough design was made using Fusion 360 from which we obtained general measurements such as the required size for the battery, controller, wheels, etc. The final scooter we made had some design change made to it, but overall we kept the dimensions the same.

Construction
-------------

To make the body of the scooter we started by making a rectangular base onto which we are going to fit the electronic controller for the motor and the 10s4p [battery pack]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/projects/ev-scooter-battery) that we used to power our scooter. 

The frame was made with steel square tubing, which we cut into the appropiate measurements for our base, the pieces where then welded using both stick and MIG welding.

We then positioned the motor and the wheel on the frame to check their fitting.

For the wheels we used 8-inch solid tires for the front and back assembly, this tires where not very good for the scooter and inflatable replacements are needed if we plan to keep using the scooter.

For the front wheel holder of the scooter we used a front fork from an old bike, which we cut and fitted to the 8 inch wheels.

To connect the front fork to the base of the scooter we used another piece of rectangular tubing.

The angle of the front fork and handle needs to be slanted a little towards the driver in order to make the scooter more conmfortable to use. In the next picture we were checking what angle was the appropiate one.

After choosing the final position of everything we proceeded to weld the whole body which resulted in the next prototype.

A wooden deck was cut to the size of the scooter, this gives the driver a place to stand as well as covering the battery compartment.

Motor connection
------------

After having a sturdy frame for the scooter we had to tackle the motor integration, for this we bought a 500W 36V DC motor together with the appropiate speed controller for it.

To make the transmission from the motor to the wheel we used bycicle sprockets and chain as can be seen in the next picture. One of the hardest parts about making the transmission was to keep a constant tension on the chain, for this purpose we implemented an adjustable small sprocket that performs the functions of a tensioner.

At the end we had a reliable transmission, although a lot of things can be improved for a first prototype we felt like it was good enough. Below you can see a GIF of the transmission running.

After tackling the transmission we mounted everything together to get a better look of how the final product would look like.

After we were happy with were everything mounted we took everything apart in order to prepare it for painting.

On the bottom part of the scooter you can see the battery and the motor speed controller.

Next you can see a GIF of a test we made of the electric scooter

Out of everything building the scooter was an awesome experience thanks to the amazing team we had.
