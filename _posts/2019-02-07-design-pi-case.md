CAD design of a Raspberry Pi retro case
===============

This is a design I made of a case in which you can fit a Raspberry Pi together with a 3.5 tft touch display.

Below are pictures of the whole design in fusion 360.

{% include gallery id="gallery-normal" class="center" caption="Raspberry Pi Retro Case" %}

Here is a closer look at the part that holds the Raspberry Pi which slides into the outside case.

{% include gallery id="gallery-holder" class="center" caption="Raspberry Pi Retro Case inside holder" %}

On one part of the face of the case for custom buttons were designed, these hold a normal push button which simply slides into the holder.

{% include gallery id="gallery-button" class="center" caption="Closer look at custom button" %}

Below you can see three renders of the whole case.

In the future I will update the post with pictures of the 3D printed case.
