Introduction
-----------

The picture below is of a Retro-themed case that I made for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 3.5" TFT Touch Screen.

CAD Design
-----------

The design was developed using Fusion 360, of which you can see a series of pictures down below.

{% include gallery id="gallery-normal" class="center" caption="Raspberry Pi Retro Case CAD" %}

Here is a closer look at the part that holds the Raspberry Pi which slides into the outside case, this part was hard to make since it had to fit correctly into the Raspberry Pi with the 3.5" Touch Screen while allowing connections to be made to the pi.

On one part of the face of the case four custom buttons were designed, these hold a normal push button which simply slides into the holder.

Renders
-----------

Below you can see some renders of the whole case.
