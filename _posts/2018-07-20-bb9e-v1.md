BB9E Version 1
===========

The idea of this project is to build a 1/3rd scale BB8 like droid, in order to achieve this some investigation had to come in hand. Different topics where researched like Drive System, Head Movement Mechanism, Motors and Electronics control.

A big source of knowledge when it comes to building BB8 Droids is the bb8builders.club where you can find different life sized builds of BB8 and also different versions like BB9E.

The project was divided in 3 main sections 

-	Analysis of existing BB8 robots and mechanisms types
-	Drive mechanism 
-	Electronics controls
-	Software controls


Dimensions analysis
--------
Official dimensions haven't been realized, but thankfully the community has quickly risen up and provided us with the dimensions. This have been obtained by measuring pictures from the BB8 in the red carpet.

For our purpose we wanted a 1/3rd scale model, that meant an overall main sphere size of 200mm.

The first time we saw BB8 in real life was in the red carpet of the Oscars, the Mechanism used for this was complex and consisted of two motors that rotate the whole sphere in order to move forward or backwards. 

In order to be able to turn this mechanism used two drive systems, the first one consisted in a pendulum that moves the left or right of the sphere in order to shift the weight of the mechanism does creating a non-holonomic system where the droid can turn within a certain curvature. The other type of rotation was implemented in the form of a rotating platform that creates a rotating momentum does allowing the sphere to spin in its main vertical axis.

The last part is the Head movement mechanism which is especially important since it's one of the BB8 main characteristics. This consisted of two shafts that rotate about the center of mass of the sphere, combining this two movements allows the head two move in 2 dimensions.

Drive system development
---------

I decided that for my drive system I would use a simpler option which is to remove the flywheel for axis rotation, the other driving options like the pendulum rotation system would be implemented as well as the Head movement mechanism; My implementation of the drive systems produces a non-holonomic movement that coupled with a software controller allows the robot to move around pretty easily.

In this section we will take a look at the mechanical part of the design; The considerations for the prototype are the next ones:

-	200mm main sphere
-	Single geared DC motor main drive 
-	Servo actuated pendulum rotation
-	Servo actuated head mechanism movement 
-	3D-Printed body parts for rapid prototyping
-	Plastic sphere body that can be opened

For the CAD design I used Fusion 360 which is a tool I'm comfortable with using and offers some great tools for quick design.

Drive mechanism V1.1
-------

The first initial design consisted of a pendulum with a central axis movement, in which the head mechanism would be mounted; I decided to discard this design since it didn't leave much room for electronic parts and the angle of the pendulum was restricted. The pictures of my initial design can be found in the next pictures.

Drive mechanism V1.2
-------

The main design changes to be made taking into consideration the initial CAD prototype were the next ones.

- Curved space inside the pendulum for the 4 18650 batteries to be used
-	Reduced main motor housing size, in order to have more angle of rotation on the pendulum.
-	Space on the top to house the head mechanism without interrupting operations of the other systems.

The designed obtained after taking into consideration the changes and having deigned the mechanism for the head movement is the next one.

Head V1.1
--------

The head movement mechanism is still in its development stage the proposed movement is a free movement in the X,Y region with a rotational movement around the Z axis. The head mechanism was mainly based on the one that some joysticks use of course heavily adapted for my needs.

The movement in X and Y has  tested and works fine, however I still need to design the top of the head along with its caster wheels which will allow the head to move smoothly.

The inside of the head will also contain electronic components which will give a better look to the robot such as RGB light and a speaker, more on that on the electronics section.
