Introduction
----------------

The other day I was in need of a tripod mount for my OnePlus 6, I used to have a generic one but as usual when i'm in need of something the object seems to magically dissapear. 

I was left with the task of getting a new one, but where is the fun in just buying one from the store, when I can design and 3D print my own version, so... that's what I did.

The design approach I took with this adapter is to use rubber bands as a way of providing a compression clamping force to hold the smartphone and also the use of a 3.5 mm metal rod as a slider for the clamp. At the end, the rubber bands worked awesome and i'm definately using them for further projects.

Version 1.0
------------

As mentioned before one of the characteristics of this project is the use of a 3.5 mm metal rod that allows the top part of the adapter to move up and down along it while providing strenght to the adapter. Below you can see a picture of the brass rod that I used, for each version a different lenght of it was used.

Once the top and bottom part of the adapter were printed I proceeded to cut the metal rods to lenght and attach them to the bottom part of the adapter using a little superglue. At first I wanted to use 3 lenghts of rod, but ended up using only two since that was enough when testing. All the parts for V1.0 can be seen in the next picture.

Below are pictures of the assembled product.

In the next two pictures you can see the two positions of the adapter, the first one is when its expanded and the rubber bands are supplying a compression clamping force, and the second is the normal state where the rubber bands are not compressing.

{% include gallery id="gallery-v1-2" class="center" caption="V1.0 Smartphone tripod adapter CAD design." %}

The take aways from this design was that the position of the rubber bands had to be in the middle of the metal rods, in order to provide a consistent clamping force. For V1.0 I used 3D printed threads to attach the adapter to the tripod, for the next version I decided to use a proper 3/8-16 nut.

Version 2.0
------------

For version V2.0, I took a lot of design elements like the way the clamps are designed, but applied improvements in order to make it more functional and also look slick.

{% include gallery id="gallery-v2-cad" class="center" caption="V2.0 Smartphone tripod adapter CAD design." %}

Below are the pictures of the 3D printed product, the design looks way better than before while keeping the original functions.

{% include gallery id="gallery-v2-1" class="center" caption="V2.0 Smartphone tripod adapter." %}

The clamping force of the adapter also got better and closes and opens without problem, as you can see in the next pictures, one thing to change is that the slot that holds the rubber bands was to short and to thin, which made the rubber bands slip out of place. 

{% include gallery id="gallery-v2-2" class="center" caption="V2.0 Smartphone tripod adapter opening and closing." %}

When I printed V2.0 another problem that I had was that the slot for the 3/8-16 nut was to small which meant I had to do some cutting.

Version 2.1
------------

All the minor problems that V2.0 had were solved in V2.1, these were not hard to correct but provided a greater reliability when using the adapter. In the next pictures you can see the design of V2.1, which major diference is that I extended the slot for the rubber bands.

{% include gallery id="gallery-v2.1-cad" class="center" caption="V2.1 Smartphone tripod adapter." %}

Below you can see a comparison of the V2.0 and V2.1 where the few changes that were made can be seen.

{% include gallery id="gallery-v2.1-1" class="center" caption="V2.0 (Right) vs V2.1 (Left)" %}

I was very happy of how V2.1 turned out and the great functionality I was getting from it, it holds my OnePlus 6 Perfectly while also allowing other sized phones to be used as well.

In the next pictures you can see a couple of phones I used to test the tripod adapter, another thing that I added was cushioning for the phone in the form of a piece of foam.
