So after sitting on the idea for a couple of months I decided to finally create my personal website.
The main reason that was keeping me back was budget, but I found a free alternative more on that later.

I have decided to divide the website into two main categories:

- Projects: Where I will show and talk about electronics projects and anything maker related that I do.
- Blogs: Just general talk in several topics such as technology, travel and anything else that comes to my mind.

More to come once i'm happy with the setup of the website which im currently developing with Jekyll and Netlify as hosting.
