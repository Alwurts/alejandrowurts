So I recently started my personal website as a way of getting my projects out in the internet as well as doing some writing about things that interest me, when looking at the options for making a website WordPress was the most popular way to go for, but the hosting that it requires was a little out of my budget, then I came across the option of using github pages as a free hosting service for static websites the only downfall is that it requires a little more technical approach to making a website but me as I like to code and learn new skills I decided to dive in. 

If you don't have much experience with web page development like I do, it can seem to be little hard but with patience and plenty of hours of research I was able to get my website somewhat presentable in about 2 days of work, there is still a lot of work to be done to get it to where I want but it will eventually get there.

One option was to build the website from the ground up using html and css, but through my research I came across website builders specifically Jekyll which it's a great option with a lot of themes and plug-ins  that help you make a great looking website, another popular website builder is Hugo but for some reason or another I went with Jekyll.

Below you can find a screenshot of the home page of my website as it looks at the time of writing this.
